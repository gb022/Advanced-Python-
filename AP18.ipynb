        "\n",
        "---> Text files and binary files differ in their representation and the way they store and interpret data. Text files contain human-readable characters encoded using a specific character encoding such as ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16. They are primarily used for storing and exchanging textual information. Text files preserve formatting and newline characters, making them suitable for storing text-based data such as documents, source code, or configuration files. On the other hand, binary files store data in a raw, non-textual format. They are not limited to human-readable characters and can represent any type of data, including images, audio, video, executables, and structured data. Binary files do not preserve formatting or newline characters, as they are designed to store data in a compact and efficient manner. They store information in binary format, comprising sequences of 0s and 1s, and require specialized software or file formats to interpret and manipulate the data they contain. Binary files are commonly used for multimedia files, databases, and any data that is not intended to be directly human-readable."

        "---> Text files are suitable for storing human-readable text, while binary files are used for storing non-textual data or when efficiency and specialized processing are required. The choice between text and binary files depends on the nature of the data, intended usage, interoperability requirements, and the need to preserve data integrity."

        "\n",
        "---> To address these issues, it is often recommended to use higher-level data serialization formats or libraries that provide cross-platform compatibility, handle byte order conversion, and offer additional features such as data type information, metadata, and error handling. Examples include JSON, XML, CSV, or specialized binary serialization libraries like Pickle or Protocol Buffers. These formats and libraries provide a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to handle different data types, ensure portability, and maintain data integrity when working with integers or other data types."
