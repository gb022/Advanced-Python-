It is a valid and common practice to leverage the flexibility of positive and negative indexing to access characters in a string based on your specific requirements. It allows you to easily access characters from either end of the string without needing to calculate indices separately."

On the other hand, slicing involves extracting a range of elements from a sequence using the colon operator within square brackets, specifying start and end indices. It creates a new sequence containing the selected elements, with the option to include a step value for regular intervals."
