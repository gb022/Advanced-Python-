        "\n",
        "1. str (Unicode Strings):\n",
        "The str type represents Unicode strings in Python. It is the default and most commonly used string object type. Unicode strings can store and manipulate text in any language and support a wide range of characters, including non-ASCII characters. The str type provides various methods and functionalities for string manipulation, formatting, searching, and more.\n",
        "2. bytes (Byte Strings):\n",
        "The bytes type represents sequences of bytes in Python. Byte strings are used to handle binary data or text encoded in specific character encodings, such as ASCII or UTF-8. Unlike str objects, bytes objects are immutable sequences of integers representing byte values (ranging from 0 to 255). Byte strings have their own set of methods and operations specific to binary data handling."

        "Python allows you to specify Unicode characters directly in string literals by using the u prefix before the string. This indicates that the string should be treated as a Unicode string, and you can include non-ASCII characters directly within the string.\n",
        "3. UTF-8 Encoded Strings:\n",
        "Python 3.X supports UTF-8 as the default source file encoding. This means that you can directly include non-ASCII Unicode characters in your string literals without any special encoding or decoding. However, you need to ensure that your source code file is saved with UTF-8 encoding."
