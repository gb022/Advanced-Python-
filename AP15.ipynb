        "2. Positional-only Parameters: Python 3.8 introduced the ability to define function parameters that can only be passed by position and not by keyword. By using a / separator in the function signature, you can indicate that certain parameters must be passed positionally.\n",
        "3. f-strings Support \"=\" for Debugging: Python 3.8 extended f-strings to support the = specifier, allowing easier debugging by printing the expression, its value, and the result.\n",
        "4. SyntaxWarning for Unqualified Exec and Eval: Python 3.8 introduced a SyntaxWarning when using exec or eval without explicitly specifying globals and locals. This helps avoid unintended behavior or potential security risks."
