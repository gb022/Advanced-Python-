It promotes code reusability, enforces a specific contract for subclasses, and allows for polymorphism in object-oriented programming languages."

This means that the assignment statement is executed during the class definition process, and the assigned value becomes a property or attribute of the class itself rather than an instance of the class."

It allows the subclass to build upon the foundation laid by the superclass and ensures that the complete initialization process is performed."

The local scope of a function, on the other hand, is limited to the function itself, and the variables defined within it are accessible only during its execution."
