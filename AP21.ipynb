        "\n",
        "---> A probability distribution provides a framework for understanding and quantifying the likelihood of different outcomes or events in a random process. While the specific values generated may be unpredictable, the distribution allows us to make informed predictions and analyze the overall probabilities associated with the random process."

These algorithms start with a seed value and use mathematical computations to produce a sequence of numbers that appear random. However, the generated sequence is not truly random, as it is completely determined by the seed value and the algorithm."

The majority of individuals will have heights close to the mean, and as we move further away from the mean in both directions, the number of individuals with those extreme heights decreases.\n",
        "The normal distribution of heights has practical implications, such as determining clothing sizes, designing ergonomic furniture, or analyzing growth patterns in children. Many other physical and biological characteristics, such as weight, blood pressure, IQ scores, and errors in measurement, also tend to follow a normal distribution."

        "In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be unpredictable. In a small number of trials or observations, the actual outcomes may deviate significantly from the expected probabilities defined by the distribution. This is due to the inherent randomness and variability of the underlying process.\n",

        "However, as the number of trials or observations grows, the behavior of the probability distribution tends to stabilize and align more closely with the expected probabilities. This is known as the law of large numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the observed frequencies of events converge to their theoretical probabilities."
