        "\n",
        "---> Some of the key differences between a NumPy array and a Pandas DataFrame include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Structure: NumPy arrays are homogeneous and have a fixed size, while Pandas DataFrames are heterogeneous and can accommodate different data types. DataFrames also have labeled axes (columns and rows) for easy indexing and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: DataFrames offer more flexibility and functionality for data manipulation, including data alignment, merging, reshaping, and handling missing values. They provide a comprehensive set of methods and functions for data analysis and transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing Data Handling: Pandas DataFrames have built-in support for handling missing data, providing functions to identify, remove, or fill missing values. NumPy arrays do not have specialized methods for missing data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexing and Selection: DataFrames provide intuitive indexing and selection mechanisms, allowing you to access data by column names, row labels, or condition-based queries. NumPy arrays primarily rely on integer-based indexing and slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "To convert between a NumPy array and a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the respective conversion functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "To convert a NumPy array to a DataFrame, you can use the pd.DataFrame() constructor by passing the NumPy array as an argument. This will create a DataFrame with default column names and indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To convert a DataFrame to a NumPy array, you can use the values attribute of the DataFrame, which returns the underlying data as a NumPy array. For example, df.values will give you the NumPy array representation of the DataFrame."

        "\n",
        "Line Chart: A line chart is a basic technique that plots the closing prices of a stock over a period of time. It represents the price trend and allows for easy visualization of price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Candlestick Chart: Candlestick charts provide more detailed information by plotting the opening, closing, high, and low prices of a stock for each time period. They are useful for identifying patterns and trends in price movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bar Chart: A bar chart represents the range between the high and low prices for each time period, using vertical bars. It also includes a horizontal line indicating the opening and closing prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving Average: Moving averages are used to smooth out price data and identify trends. Techniques like Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) plot the average price over a specified period, allowing for easier identification of trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands combine a moving average with upper and lower bands that represent standard deviations from the average. They are used to identify volatility and potential price reversals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Volume Chart: Volume charts plot the trading volume associated with a stock over time. They help identify periods of high or low trading activity, which can provide insights into market sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is an indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine overbought or oversold conditions. It is often plotted as a line chart, helping traders identify potential reversal points.\n",
        "\n",
        "MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): MACD is a popular indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price. It is plotted as a line chart and helps identify potential trend reversals."
